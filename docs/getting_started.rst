Getting Started
=================

Installation
-------------
The package is available on pypi.org <https://pypi.org/projects/pyjengahq>.

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install pyjengahq

First Things First
--------------------
Generating an openSSL private/public key pair.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Since **v2** of the API, JengaHQ now requires some APIs to include signatures as a security measure.
This signatures are usually generated by signing some request fields with a private key.
In order to use JengaHQ you'll have to upload your public key to the developer console on JengaHQ after you generate your key pair.

This Library provides a CLI command to help you generate those keys.

.. note::
   The generated keys will be stored in your home directory under the *.JengaAPI/keys/* folder and this is where by default the Library looks for your private key when initiating JengaRequest Objects.

After Installation, Generate Your Keys using the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ jenga_gen_key_pair

.. note::
   Then copy the `~/.JengaApi/keys/publickey.pem` to your developer console on JengaHq.

Using The APIs
-------------------------------

Creating JengaAPI objects
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
By Design, interaction with all Jenga APIs functionality uses the `jengahq.auth.JengaAPI` class which takes the following parameters:

* api_key: Your Jenga API Key
* password: Your Jenga API Password
* merchant_code:: the merchant code provided by JengaHQ
* env:: the environment in which  the API is to be used either *sandbox* or *production*
* private_key:: the path to the merchant private key default is "~/.JengaAPI/keys/privatekey.pem"
* sandbox_url:: the url used to access the Sandbox API
* live_url:: the url used to access the Production API

**Example**

.. code-block:: python

    import jengahq
    jengaApi = jengahq.JengaAPI(
        api_key="Basic TofFGUeU9y448idLCKVAe35LmAtLU9y448idLCKVAe35LmAtL",
        password="TofFGUeU9y448idLCKVAe35LmAtL",
        merchant_code="4144142283",
        env="sandbox",
    )
